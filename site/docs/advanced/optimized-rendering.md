# Optimized Rendering

::: warning TODO
Oh no, this section of the documentation is missing! It still needs to be written! Aaargh! But here's something important that you should know in the meantime: if you're experimenting with three-elements, and something is not rendering as expected, just plug the `autorender` attribute into your `<three-game>` element -- it's the lazy way out, but it will generally make things work. It should look like this:

```html
<three-game autorender>...</three-game>
```

And do check back here, three-elements' Optimized Rendering is pretty cool!
